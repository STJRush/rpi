#######################################################################

To first log into your Pi remotely from a PC, Phone or ipad

#######################################################################

Before you start, you need a HDMI cable the first time you setup your pi.
You can't skip that part. Have the network passord saved on your pi before you try any of this.



Okay so time you start up your pi and connect remotely, you'll have to "Secure Shell" (aka: ssh) into the pi.
This is that super slick black hacker screen with the green text. 

To do this you'll need an "ssh" application. Now it depends on what you're using to 
talk to your Raspberry Pi.


- On a windows computer you can download a program 
  called "puttty.exe"

  You can download that here:
  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

- On an ipad, you can use an app called "iTerminal" or "everauditor" from the app store.

- On an android device you can use an app called "Juice" from the play store.



No matter what you're using you're going to need three things:

- The ip address of your pi on your netowrk  eg. 192.168.1.8

- The Login and Password for your Pi. The default is login "pi" Password "Raspberry"
  (don't forget there's a "p" in Raspberry!)

- The port (which by default tends to be 22 for ssh)


## WHERE DO I FIND MY IP ADDRESS?? ##

Okay so you need to plug your Pi via HDMI cable into a TV or monitor. 
Start it up and when on the desktop open the LXTerminal.
This is also found under programs>other>LXTerminal.
Now type the following:

Hostname -I

That's with a capital I and a minus symbol. What will pop up in response (providing you've
a WiFi dongle in your Pi and are conencted to a network) is something like

192.168.0.2


This is the address of your pi on your network. (Watch out this can change after a few days!)


##Oh Man! I've no HDMI slot on my TV or Monitor##

Oh you just had to go and make life hard didn't you? Roll them sleeves up.

Okay, here's what you can try (and best of luck because this is the scenic route)

In your internet browser on your home PC, find the page for your internet router and type
this into the URL address bar.

The address is ususally something like 192.168.0.1

For your own router, you can find the actual address and default password on this amazing
 website: http://portforward.com/default_username_password/

Serach the make and model of your router on that website. You can also check if it's 
physically written onto the back of your router on a sticker.
 

Once you've logged into the router from your browser, look around to see if you can find
a list of all of the address of all of the devices on your network. It may looks something like:

192.168.0.3

192.168.0.16

192.168.0.22

192.168.0.23


The bad news is that the router may not say which address is which. One of this is your Pi (if
you've conected it before and it knows your WiFi password). So you'll just have to try typing 
each of them into your SSH application until one of them connects. Have fun with that.

##

Oh noes! I've never connected my Pi to this network so it won't know my password and won't connect!

##

Sorry but you're going to need a HDMI cable the first time you connect. I suppose you could get into
it from somewhere where you can connect, then add that other network and password. But if it's the
first time you start up your pi, you're going to need a HDMI cable connection. 





#########################################################################

   Once you've logged in through a Secure Shell (ssh), it's desktop time!

#########################################################################

You need to install a program on your pi called tightVNC. This is a remote desktop application. To install it, open the terminal and type this: (you can also copy paste. To do so, select the text below, then in ther terminal, middle click with the mouse)



sudo apt-get update



sudo apt-get install tightvncserver




You will be asked to set a password. The default password we will use for each pi is:



passpi1



For the second school raspberry pi, the number changes so it'll be



passpi2




and so on and so forth for the third and following raspberry pi's will be passpi3 etc


A remote desktop needs to be turned on at both ends:


1. In your Raspberry pi, someone needs to start a VNC server. To do this they type in terminal:

vncserver :1

This sets up a remote desktop on port number 1.


2. on your PC, Phone or ipad, you can now connect to that server that's been setup on your pi.


- On a PC, you can download tightvnc. You can find it here:
http://www.tightvnc.com/

- On an ipad, you can download the appVNC Viewer (free).

- On an android, you can dowload whatever VNC viewer you can find (let me know, it's late
and I can't be bothered going to see what works on my android phone right now. Google something with
VNC in it. Email me if you get it working so I can add it here. Dcuish@gmail.com)


No matter what you use, you'll need to type the IP address of your pi with the port added in with
a colon. For example:

192.168.1.12:1

##
Wooooah hang on! What's with that :1 at the end?
##


Rememeber we typed "vncserver :1" ? 

That started the server on port number 1. When you type an ip address, you can add the
port at the end by putting in a : and a port number. This is something that took me ages to
figure out. 

Some VNC apps might have a seperate port number box and you can type the port number there
instead.

To install the Pibrella purple board that allows you to control motors, lights & buzzers

#########################################################################################


For more go to
http://pibrella.com/#setup

Type the following into LX Terminal:


sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade


When asked (y/n) type "y" to go ahead with the 200MB update.


**This update can take up to 40mnis! Go get a sandwich**



sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo pip install pibrella

Making VNC server start automatically on startup (you can skip this if you want, it's not needed)

#################################################################################################

The following is copy pasta from adafruit.
You can find the source webpage here:

https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-lesson-7-remote-control-with-vnc/running-vncserver-at-startup


Connecting to your Raspberry Pi remotely with VNC is fine as long as your Pi does not reboot. 
If it does, then you either have to connect with SSH and restart the VNC Server or arrange for
 the VNC Server to run automatically after the Raspberry Pi reboots.

There are several different methods of arranging for some code to be run as the Pi starts.
 The method described below is probably the easiest to use. You can adapt it to run other 
commands instead of starting the VNC server.


##Step 1.

Open a Terminal session on the Pi, or connect using SSH. A new terminal or SSH session will automatically start you off in your home directory of /home/pi. If you are not in this directory, change to it by typing:
Copy Code

cd /home/pi

Then cd to the .config directory by typing:

cd .config

Note the '.' at the start of the folder name. This makes it a hidden folder that will not 
show up when you type 'ls'.



##Step 2.
Issue the command below to create a new directory inside .config called 'autostart'.


mkdir autostart


cd into that new directory by typing:


cd autostart




##Step 3.

All that remains is to edit a new configuration file. 
So type the following command to open the nano editor on the new file:


nano tightvnc.desktop



Edit the contents of the file with the following text.


[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=TightVNC
Exec=vncserver :1
StartupNotify=false

Type ctrl-X and then Y to save the changes to the file.

Thats all there is to it. The next time you reboot the VNC server 
will restart automatically.
